Working with a company's email network where each node corresponds to a person at the company, 
and each edge indicates that at least one email has been sent between two people.

The network also contains the node attributes Department and ManagementSalary.

Department indicates the department in the company which the person belongs to, and 
ManagementSalary indicates whether that person is receiving a management position salary.

Salary Prediction Using network G, identify the people in the network with missing values 
for the node attribute ManagementSalary and predict whether or not these individuals are 
receiving a management position salary.

Your predictions will need to be given as the probability that the corresponding employee
is receiving a management position salary.

The evaluation metric for this project is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
